## Description

This is a weather dashboard that I've written. It fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap weather tracking API to display a five-day forecast. Alongside this, it has present buttons to view the forecasts of eight different cities, and a field input search bar for the user to enter any city of their choosing.

## Credits

I, Kyle Oros, wrote the program, with light assistance provided by an AskBCS Learning Assistant, and Google's Bard AI tool.
